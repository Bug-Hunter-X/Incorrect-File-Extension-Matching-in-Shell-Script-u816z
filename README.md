This repository contains a shell script demonstrating a common error in file extension matching within a for loop. The script intends to process files based on their extensions, but a flaw in how the file extension is checked causes it to fail. A solution is provided that addresses this issue using parameter expansion or the case statement.  The bug is in the way the file extension is checked inside the if statement, leading to incorrect file processing.
